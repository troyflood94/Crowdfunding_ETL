# Introduction
For the ETL mini project, we will work to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After we transform the data, we'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, weâ€™ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

ETL (Extract, Transform & Load) is a foundational skill. In the real world, data is everywhere and often scattered across multiple sources, and it can be messy. Understanding how to extract, load, and transform data is a critical concept as it enables you to have clean, up-to-date, and accurate data. It empowers you to become an expert in your data by allowing you to manipulate data types, fix formatting issues, and create additional columns to enrich and gain meaningful insights from your data.
